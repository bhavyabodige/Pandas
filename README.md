# Covid -19 Data Science Project
This Project is based on the covid-19 data which i have taken from a sample csv file which contains the information about the covid 19 data accross the world.
I have uploaded and started working on that dataset. Itâ€™s fun to explore the data. Remember, the dataset is not perfect but we can improve it by analyzing and processing it to get the information accordingly.

I have used the CSV file which I have  downloaded from the below link :
